You probably heard, or even using right now, the worldwide social messaging app. And although it is owned by the same company, I'm not talking about Facebook or FB Messenger. I'm talking about the popular mobile app, WhatsApp.

Many people around the world are using this app on a daily basis to send simple, short messages to their friends, colleagues and family. And as of such, the WhatsApp developer team has to make the experience of using their app the best possible, and the most fun for sure.

We all know there are alternatives with richer messages. Telegram, Messenger, Kik and stuff. However, No one can beat the user base WhatsApp has, and for that, we are tied to their services.

Recently, they were graceful enough to finally bring us Stickers support for the app, something many apps had before. It was a surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one. However, when I tested this feature, I realized the only way to make my own sticker pack, I need to develop a whole new Android app and have people install it from the store (or through APK, but ordinary people won't do that). So I realized a solution to that problem must be made, so any person could create and share any kind of sticker pack they want, easily and without any hassle, directly from their mobile device.

Introducing ***StickerMaker for WhatsApp*** by Idoideas, a simple way to enrich your stickers experience on WhatsApp, without the need of any programming knowledge.

## So what can you do in this app?

* Create and organize your very own sticker packs by pack name and creator.
* Share your newly created packs to your friends using WhatsApp itself as Zip files, as easily as clicking a button.
* Load your friends' original packs to your WhatsApp client by sharing the files received to the app. No need of installing additional apps for additional packs.
* Modify packs that were created using the app to your liking!

## Notice!

***Sticker packs created using the app and loaded using the app require the app to stay installed on the device and loaded on it if you want to use them.***

**If you happen to remove the app from your device, the sticker packs will be removed from your WhatsApp client and your packs will be lost if weren't shared.***
